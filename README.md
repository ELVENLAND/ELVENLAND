Elvenland is a new cryptocurrency project that you can get by overcoming levels of a game designed by its team. The way of earning these cryptocurrencies makes it a little more interesting to obtain them and seeks to attract those people who are not yet familiar with this new type of currency.

Elvenland is a project consisting of 26 products (tokens) that have a specific intended use. Let‚Äôs talk a little bit about them.

For example, Danko is a token intended to pay for the services of freelancers hired by individuals, and Amiko is a token destined to pay rewards to companies and institutions that carry out an agreement with the Elvenland project, sealing a pact of friendship and joint work between both.

the last token mentioned is only two of many that we have for you.

In addition to these products, Elvenland offers a variety of offline products.
